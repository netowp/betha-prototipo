# What to think about this?

Well. Let's say I open my IPTU and I want to see some things related to what I want. 
I do want to know how much and when I need to pay the bill. And since I have to pay it every year,
I would love to see a history of how much it was in previous years. It might be handy.

Well, I would also like to have information they have about my house. OK, not everything, 
but I would like to check if the address matches my addres and if their information does as well.

## I need to check privary concers about having information about my home as well.
